# EECE570 Final Project â€“ Retinal Fundus Disease Classifier  
**Author:** Andrew Feng (ID: 12039012)  
**Course:** EECE 570 - Computer Vision  

## Project Overview
This project implements a multi-label disease classifier for retinal fundus images using a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model. It explores classification performance on a medical dataset through training, evaluation, and fine-tuning pipelines. The goal is to effectively detect key retinal diseases, addressing class imbalance and real-world diagnostic challenges.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available here:
